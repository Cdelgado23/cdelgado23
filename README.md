# :wave: About me

Hello! I am Carlos Delgado, a passionate Software Engineer based anywhere in Extremadura, Spain.

I am currently working at **Orquest**, specializing in Cloud and Infrastructure modernization. Software development is
not only my job, but also a hobby, so I keep exploring whenever I have the chance.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me lost playing the piano :musical_keyboard:, in the pages of a good book :books:,
enjoying video games :video_game:, or cuddling with my dogs :dog2: :dog2: :dog2:.

## :open_book: Learning about ...

- Infrastructure as Code
