# About me

Hello! I am Carlos Delgado, a passionate Software Engineer based anywhere in Extremadura, Spain. 

I am currently working at **Orquest**, specializing in Cloud and Infrastructure modernization. Software development is not only my job, but also a hobby, so I keep exploring whenever I have the chance. 

When I'm not coding, you'll find me lost playing the piano, in the pages of a good book, enjoying video games, or cuddling with my dogs. 

## Learning about ...
- Infrastructure as Code
- Go
